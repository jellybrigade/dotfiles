# Special stuff

## Tmux

<p>Leader: CTRL + Space</p>
<p>nvim $('fzf --preview='bat {}') = Leader + o</p>
<p>Set up 3 Tmux windows in current directory, 2nd window has a 3 terminal split, second has a 4 terminal split</p>

## NVIM

honestly just look through it, lots of options, everything should be described in whichkey. based on LazyVim.
